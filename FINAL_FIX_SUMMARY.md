# Final Fix Summary - Delta Display

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### Issue: Delta text (Coins/Crops) not showing

The conditional logic was too complex and wasn't properly detecting when to show the delta values.

### Solution: Simplified the display logic

Changed from complex nested conditionals to a cleaner approach that:

1. Checks if `myTeam` exists
2. Calculates the value (handles both functions and numbers)
3. Returns `null` if no value exists
4. Otherwise displays the delta with proper color

## üìä What You Should See Now

### Scenario 1: Pest Outbreak Spreading

-   **Buy Pesticide:** `Coins: -200` (red), `Crops: -1` (red)
-   **Natural Remedy:** `Coins: -50` (red), `Crops: -2` (red)
-   **Do Nothing:** `Coins: 0` (green), `Crops: 0` (green)

### Scenario 2: Market Opportunity (with 8 crops)

-   **Sell Half:** `Coins: +800` (green), `Crops: -4` (red)
-   **Keep All:** `Coins: 0` (green), `Crops: 0` (green)

### Scenario 3: Drought Warning

-   **Invest in Drip Irrigation:** `Coins: -300` (red), `Crops: -1` (red)
-   **Buy Water Rights:** `Coins: -150` (red), `Crops: -2` (red)
-   **Do Nothing:** `Coins: 0` (green), `Crops: 0` (green)

### Scenario 4: Final Harvest (with 5 crops)

-   **Sell Remaining Crops:** `Coins: 0` (green), `Crops: -5` (red)

## üé® Color Coding

-   **Green text:** Positive or zero values (0, +800, +50)
-   **Red text:** Negative values (-200, -4, -1)
-   **Bold:** All delta values are bold for visibility

## üîß How to See the Changes

### Step 1: Refresh Browser

The server is already running and has compiled the new code.

**Hard refresh:**

-   Press `Ctrl + Shift + R`
-   Or `Ctrl + F5`

### Step 2: Clear Browser Cache (if needed)

If hard refresh doesn't work:

1. Press `F12` to open DevTools
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### Step 3: Clear localStorage (if needed)

Open console (`F12`) and run:

```javascript
localStorage.clear();
sessionStorage.clear();
location.reload();
```

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

Go through each scenario and verify:

-   [ ] Scenario 1 - All 3 options show delta values
-   [ ] Scenario 2 - "Sell Half" shows `+800` coins and `-4` crops
-   [ ] Scenario 2 - "Keep All" shows `0` coins and `0` crops
-   [ ] Scenario 3 - All 3 options show delta values
-   [ ] Scenario 4 - Shows `0` coins and `-X` crops (where X = your current crops)

## üéØ Expected Behavior

### Before Submission:

Shows the **predicted changes** in green/red text below each option.

### After Submission:

1. **Your Outcome** section shows the actual changes applied
2. **Your Farm After This Decision** shows your current totals

### Scenario 4 Behavior:

When you submit "Sell Remaining Crops":

-   Coins: NO change (stays the same)
-   Crops: Becomes 0 (all crops removed)

## üìù Code Changes Made

### File: `app/player/scenario/page.tsx`

**Before:** Complex nested conditionals that weren't working
**After:** Clean, simple logic:

```typescript
{
	myTeam && (
		<>
			{/* Coins Delta */}
			{(() => {
				const coinsValue =
					typeof choice.coinsDelta === "function"
						? choice.coinsDelta(myTeam)
						: typeof choice.coinsDelta === "number"
						? choice.coinsDelta
						: null;

				if (coinsValue === null) return null;

				return (
					<span
						className={
							coinsValue >= 0
								? "text-green-600 font-semibold"
								: "text-red-600 font-semibold"
						}
					>
						Coins: {coinsValue >= 0 ? "+" : ""}
						{coinsValue}
					</span>
				);
			})()}

			{/* Crops Delta - same pattern */}
		</>
	);
}
```
